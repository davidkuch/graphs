# graphs
A C++ implementation of graph data structure and algorithms.

#  goal
The long-run goal of this project is to create easy to use infrastructure
for solving various problems that can be translated to Graph problem.
A secondary goal is to explore and prepare the ground for the implementation
of the DDG - Dynamic Distributed Graph, a project by itself, that would simulate
real world, dynamically changing interactions, such as network nodes connectivity,
and explore the ongoing changes.
